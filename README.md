Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Your Task
Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. The link should take you to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API. You will need to register for an API key in order to use this API. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

The base URL for your API calls should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

Hint: Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you'll notice that you will need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name?
You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly



## Acceptance Criteria

Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

- The city name
- The date   -
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity
- The wind speed


When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity


When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city


## Mock-Up
